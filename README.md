## Features

### Model Management
- **List Local Models**: View a list of all locally available models, including their size and last modified date.
- **Show Model Information**: Display detailed information about a selected model.
- **Pull a Model**: Download a new model from the Ollama library.
- **Remove a Model**: Delete a selected model from the local storage.

### Testing
- **Model Feature Test**: Test a model's capability to handle JSON and function calls.
- **Model Comparison by Response Quality**: Compare the response quality of multiple models for a given prompt.
- **Contextual Response Test by Model**: Test how well a model maintains context across multiple prompts.
- **Vision Model Comparison**: Compare the performance of vision models using the same test image.
