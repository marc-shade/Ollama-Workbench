* **Ollama Server:** Ollama Workbench requires Ollama Server to be installed and running. The setup script will help you install it if needed.

### Simple 2-Step Installation

1. **Set up the environment:**
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```
   This automated script:
   - Finds or installs Python 3.11
   - Creates a properly configured virtual environment
   - Installs all dependencies in the correct order
   - Creates a launcher script

2. **Run Ollama Workbench:**
   ```bash
   ./run_ollama_workbench.sh
   ```
   The launcher automatically ensures everything is set up correctly before starting the application.

### What the Setup Script Does

The `setup.sh` script handles all the complexity for you:

- Finds Python 3.11 on your system or installs it if needed
- Creates a dedicated virtual environment with the exact correct Python version
